<h3 align="center">AI Based Mask Detection System</h3>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>It is used to detect whether people are wearing the masks or not.</h4>
</div>

## :innocent: Motivation

<div align= "center">
  <h4>Prevention is better than cure</h4>
</div>

âœ”WHO advises to wear mask and prevent touching Nose, Face and Eyes.<br />
âœ”There is no vaccine till now, and wearing masks is one of the only way to get rid of this virus.<br />
âœ”Prevention is the only way to control spread of Novel Corona Virus and will lead of flattening of curve.<br />


## :star: Unique Selling Point (Mask Detection System)

âœ”Red: mask Pink: no_mask : with their detection probabilities on top of each bounding box.<br />
âœ”This system is highly scalable and can detect multiple streams in optimal time.<br />
âœ”This has great use in surveillance and security purpose to find out who all are following the rules.<br />

## :key: How to install

It is a software that can take feed from existing CCTV/IP cameras and show the results.

## :clap: Use Cases

âœ” Can be used at hospitals<br />
âœ” Can be used at Railway Stations<br />
âœ” Can be used at Crowded Areas<br />
âœ” Can be used at Market Places and Malls<br />

<h2 align="center">AI Based Social Distancing Monitoring System</h2>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>It is used to detect whether people are following the social distancing or not</h4>
</div>

## :innocent: Motivation

âœ” WHO advises to maintain social distancing.<br />
âœ” Minimum permissible distance is 1 metre (3 feet).<br />
âœ” Prevention is the only way to control spread of Novel Corona Virus and will lead of flattening of curve.<br />

## :star: Unique Selling Point (Social Distancing System)

âœ” This is our AI Product to check if commuters in the monitored area are following Social Distancing or not.<br />
âœ” Red: Alert, Green: Distancing maintained<br />
âœ” Contrary to others, this system is highly scalable and can detect multiple streams in optimal time.<br />
âœ” The USP is that distance between two people is independent of their heights as well as it can detect upto 1000 people in a single frame.<br />
âœ” This system is based on Deep Learning and not on Conventional Computer Vision<br />
âœ” Can be deployed on edge and cloud both.<br />

<h2 align="center">AI Based Redness of Eye Detection</h2>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>This snippet of software will aim at detecting the people who are having conjunctivitis in their eyes</h4>
</div>

## :innocent: Motivation

âœ” Conjunctivitis(Red Eye) is considered as the symptom of Covid19 as per the guidelines of World Health Organization.
.<br />
âœ” Our software detects red eyes and raises alert for probability of person being infected.<br />

## :key: How to install

It is a software that can take feed from existing cameras and show the results.

<h2 align="center">AI Based Fever Detection</h2>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>This snippet of software will aim at detecting the people who have high body temperatures.</h4>
</div>

## :innocent: Motivation

âœ” We have considered the Human Face as Region of Interest to calculate the thermal temperature<br />

âœ” Our system will couple AI Based ROI Detection + Temperature Calculation in ROI<br />

âœ” Things to look for: If a person carries coffee or any hot food item, it wonâ€™t be considered for temperature calculation. <br />

âœ” Our software detects red eyes and raises alert for probability of person being infected.<br />


## :hourglass: Project Demo

## ðŸš€&nbsp; Installation
It is a software that can take feed from existing CCTV/IP cameras and show the results.

To set up on your local:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com//Sonali210/Covid-Sentine.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo and create a Python virtual environment named 'test'
```
$ mkvirtualenv test
```

3. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## :bulb: Working

 Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory folder and type the following command:
1. For face mask detection:
```
$ python facemask.py
```

2. For Social Distancing: 
```
$ python3 
```

3. For conjunctivitis:
```
$ python3
```
